### Who am I?

I'm a brazilian guy, living with my lovely wife and my beautiful daughers. I'm also an I.T. professional working as Linux Sysadmin since 1999. Recently I'm dedicating myself to learn everything I can about Devops and SRE.
Even not being a developer, I love to code always I can, and I do it using mostly PHP, Perl or Bash.

Well... this is the first draft, with time I'll write some other things here.
Bye!
